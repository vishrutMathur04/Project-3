Thoughts

I looked through the project requirements and confirmed that one Python file is enough.
I think starting with block I/O and the header layout makes the most sense.

Plan
Creating a new file called project_3.py
Implement block read/write helpers and the header structure.
Keep everything minimal and clean so later code integrates easily.
